We can do this through the transaction dataframe, where we count, for each unique household key, how many times that household occurs. gather the data for those households, and assemble a numpy array that can be passed into an XGBClassifier. This classifier will be provided the data of customers who have purchased multiple times and what their behavior is, and then will be used to predict on the households who have only purchased once to see who is most likely. The XGBClassifier will return values ranging between 0 and 1, which will reflect a probability or confidence of repurchase. We could then have an algorithm process the predictions and report back who exceeded a certain threshold based on what amount of confidence we ask that algorithm specifically to look for."

    "## *STARTING OVER*\n",
    "Starting over because I realized I'm doing this in a way that I don't feel is right. I split the transactions with regards to stores which I think is appropriate, but I have way too many variables. I think I started with way too information instead of first brainstorming what I think would actually be important in indicating what will lead to repurchase. On one hand, brainstorming first can lead to some variables being left out that would actually be pretty important such as coupon discount, sale discount total (the actual amount of money saved from the coupon), the week number, etc. But on the other hand, I think brainstorming can help provide direction and can help keep the task manageable. On top of this, it's always possible to engineer more categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### What To Do Next?\n",
    "So I think I will first start by removing categories that I think are unnecessary. Then I will split the dataframes first into separate stores, then group by households. This way, we will train the ML algorithm to look at each household's transaction history and determine for that household the confidence of repurchase for that particular store.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Which categories are important?\n",
    "I think the amount and different types of people within the household are important.I could do something where we determine how many purchases each household has made along with some bits of info on the household and use that to determine repurchase confidence, but I think that's less accurate because it doesn't take into account whether the transactions they made were based on whether there was a sale, how often those transactions were, etc. \n",
    "- Time stamps I think are unnecessary because I don't think the fact someone purchased groceries at 7 in the morning will mean anything when it's been a week since that person has bought groceries and may need more. \n",
    "- income and age I think can be significant because perhaps a certain purchase was a gift and that household may or may not purchase from that store again because that store personally does not appeal to them but may appeal to the person they purchased the gift for, therefore limiting the amount of times that household returns to the store to purchase anything. \n",
    "- household owners or renters can be important, might be overshadowed by income range but ownership status may be a personal choice and reflect some hidden personality pattern that would otherwise be hidden if we did not include ownership status\n",
    "- which products were purchased I think are important because certain products may not need to be purchased as often as others, such as salt versus eggs, etc. The amount of each product purchased I think will also be important. The way the transaction dataframe is set up is that each item purchased is listed versus each cart/full transaction. So each item purchased has a basket ID that contained that particular item. With this in mind, i may actually want to approach this as a transaction-based list, where each transaction has each product listed and the quantity of those products listed as well. this way it will be a more accurate way of representing how often this particular household comes in to purchase goods.\n",
    "- Sales value and other discount related categories are very significant because a particular household's transactions may consist primarily of discounted purchases and thus may only be a patron if there are coupons and discounts available. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Which Categories Should I drop?\n",
    "I think any category that gets too granular and/or doesn't actually represent anything relevant to a transaction such as previous number of items purchased, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Outstanding Questions and Thoughts\n",
    "My first concern is how the ML algorithm will absorb/process the number of transactions each household has made. Some households have over 700 transactions, whereas some literally only have 1. So in terms of how to separate these and/or take this into account, I guess I will find out as I approach actually loading the data into the XGBoost algorithm. Maybe I will only train on households with transactions over 500, and then test it on everyone, but then how will I put in 1 transaction from a household into the algorithm and have that data be the same shape as a household with 500 purchases? I could enter in N/A for every transaction that hasn't happened but now I'm wondering if that will add some unintended weight to certain cateories. I could simplify this and have the algorithm only train on household info and train on every single household that purchased for a particular store and feed it how many purchases each household made at that store, and then have it predict whether a household will repurchase based on previous number of transactions at which store and which products were bought and how much, *and that actually would have a much wider application considering that would be a great way to forecast sales based on previous customers, help create estimates for a loyalty program, and other applications to other problems that this whole \"10 retail-based data science projects\" wants to cover.* Maybe we actually do that instead^. The main issue we face is the fact that we haven't yet decided how to determine if that customer made a repeat purchase. Maybe it's as simple as asking if this household has purchased more than once from this store, and if so it's a repeat customer. But then how do we test it? the tricky part here is the fact that any customer could stop coming to the store at any point and there would be no indication that this customer never comes back. But maybe the concern here is to worry about people who have only made one purchase. Maybe the point here is to leave whether this customer returns after a couple purchases up to them, but once they exceed a threshold that's when you start marketing to them? These are all questions that lead to other parts of retail which is valuable, but I also want to make a point of sticking to repurchase. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Alright, So What The Fuck Are We Doing, Then? Have We Decided?\n",
    "Based on the conclusion that I reached after writing out my thoughts, I've decided that I'm going to train the algorithm on each household that patronized each store. So, I want to go over what the data will look like. In no particular order, though I want to put emphasis on the categories that come first here, the columns will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Household size (This includes all the sex and kid # categories)\n",
    "- Household age\n",
    "- Household income\n",
    "- Ownership status\n",
    "- Number of purchases at each store\n",
    "- Number of each product purchased (products that have zero purchases across the board should be eliminated from that store's dataframe considering that item might not exist at that store)\n",
    "- Total amount saved via coupons (this will come in three categories, the first being just flat-out how much did this person save in terms of raw dollars. the second category will be the amount this person saved with respect to how much they spent. A larger saved to paid ratio will indicate a larger concern to save. And the third category will be the ratio of transactions that used coupons to transactions that did not. A larger ratio will indicate the same patterns as the second category)\n",
